## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# PS 6 for Dr Ransom

#I've decided to look at draft data of NFL quarterback since 2000 to 2015. I want to see the breakdown of quarterbacks drafted per year and per round.
First, I'm going to look at the per year data. Second, I will break it down by QBs per round. 

I'm downloading a Kaggle dataset that contains every player drafted since 1985.
The URL is: https://www.kaggle.com/ronaldjgrafjr/nfl-draft-outcomes
The code and histogram is to follow:

  
```{r}
draft.raw <- read.csv("nfl_draft.csv")

NFLqbYEAR <- data.frame(Year=draft.raw$Year,
                       QBs=draft.raw$Pos)

NFLqbROUND <- data.frame(Round=draft.raw$Rnd,
                         QBs=draft.raw$Pos)

NFLqbAGE <- data.frame(age=draft.raw$Age,
                         QBs=draft.raw$Pos)

library(dplyr)
NFLqbYEAR <- NFLqbYEAR %>% filter(as.character(QBs)=="QB" & Year > 1999)

NFLqbROUND <- NFLqbROUND %>% filter(as.character(QBs)=="QB")

NFLqbAGE <- NFLqbAGE %>% filter(as.character(QBs)=="QB")
  
```
The following will be histograms visually demonstrating the data above. 
the histograms will be created using the below code:
NFLqbAGE
  
```{r}

Number of QBs Drafted per Year Since 2000
ggplot(NFLqbYEAR, aes(Year)) + geom_bar()

```

Number of QBs Taken Per Round Since 1985
ggplot(NFLqbROUND, aes(Round)) + geom_bar()

Age of QB at Draft, 1985-2000 
ggplot(NFLqbAGE, aes(age)) + geom_bar()

```
